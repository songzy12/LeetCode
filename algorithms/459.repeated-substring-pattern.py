#Let's say T = S + S.
#"S is Repeated => From T[1:-1] we can find S" is obvious.

#If from T[1:-1] we found S at index p-1, which is index p in T and S.
#let s1 = S[:p], S can be represented as s1s2...sn, where si stands for substring rather than character.
#then we know T[p:len(S) + p] = s2s3...sn-1sns1 = S = s1s2...sn-2sn-1sn.
#So s1 = s2, s2 = s3, ..., sn-1 = sn, sn = s1,Which means S is Repeated.

#edit:
#I should fix this because len(si) == len(sj) has not be proved. The procedure becomes complicated :-(
#Let s1 = S[:p], S can be represented as s1X1.
#then S = X1s1 = s1X1 (A).

#    len(X1) < len(s1) is false because if so we should find S in T[1:-1] at index len(X1) rather than len(s1) = p.

#    len(X1) == len(s1) and (A) => X1 = s1 => S is Repeated.

#    len(X1) > len(s1) and (A) => X1 has prefix s1 so can be represented as s1X2.
#    X1 = s1X2 and (A) => s1X2s1= s1s1X2 =>X2s1 = s1X2 (B).
#    len(X2) < len(s1) is false because if so (A) and (B) => S = X2s1s1 = s1s1X2 and we should find S at index len(X2) rather than p.

#    As long as len(Xi-1) > len(s1), we can get Xis1 = s1Xi through the prefix step and prove len(Xi) < len(s1) is false through the index step. Eventually we can get a Xn, len(Xn) == len(s1) and Xns1 = s1Xn => Xn = s1 => S = s1X1 = s1s1X2 = ... = s1s1...s1Xn-1 = s1s1...s1s1Xn => S is Repeated.
